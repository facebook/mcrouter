/**
 * This test provides an example of how to use the CarbonRouterClient API.
 *
 * The recommended usage pattern is:
 *   1. In order to use mcrouter, the client needs a CarbonRouterInstance,
 *      obtained through one of the static factory methods. In most long-lived
 *      programs, CarbonRouterInstance::init() is the way to go.
 *   2. Create a CarbonRouterClient object associated to the
 *      CarbonRouterInstance via CarbonRouterInstance::createClient() or
 *      CarbonRouterInstance::createSameThreadClient().
 *   3. Send requests through mcrouter via CarbonRouterClient::send(). (With
 *      some caveats; read the comments below.)
