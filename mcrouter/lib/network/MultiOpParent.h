/**
 * We use this struct to track the state of multi-op operations
 * for in-order protocols.
 *
 * Consider the request "get a b". This generates four contexts:
 *   block_ctx, a_ctx, b_ctx, end_ctx
 *
 * The purpose of the block_ctx is to prevent any writes until
 * both a and b complete (it's a hack that uses the head of line
 * blocking property of the in-order protocol).
 *
 * a_ctx and b_ctx are the real contexts dispatched to the application,
 * and they both have back pointers to this parent struct.
 *
 * end_ctx is for writing the END message on the wire.
 *
 * Error handling: if either a or b returns an error, we want to
 * turn the entire reply into a single error reply.
 * How it's implemented: if b_ctx returns an error, we'll store the error
 * reply in the parent. Then when unblocked, both a_ctx and b_ctx
 * will check that the parent has a stored error and will not
 * write anything to the transport (same as if 'noreply' was set).
 *
 * Finally the end context will write out the stored error reply.
